# Scanning Applications

## How do we extract our intel? 

In this section, we are going to perform the extraction of software intelligence from some custom applications. We will show you the process the way it's actually carried out for real client engagements. Don't worry - it's actually very straightforward. 

Before we generate insights about our applications, we have some setup to do. Here's the plan:

- Register as a CAST Highlight user
- Get a couple apps that we want to analyze
- Download and launch the analyzer
- Upload the results to the CAST Highlight platform.

The overview of this process looks like this:
