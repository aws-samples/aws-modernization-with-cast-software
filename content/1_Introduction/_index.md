## Modernize to cloud and on cloud 

Cloud migration has been a major trend in the past years. "Lift & Shift" migrations allowed organizations to rapidly benefit from cloud infrastructure capabilities with minimal disruption and effective costs. However, rehosted applications may not leverage all the powerful capabilities of cloud-native services including high performance, automated scalability, security, resiliency or more advanced services such as modern databases, analytics and AI.

On-premises applications are typically the most complex or monolithic stacks, developed over the years by changing development teams, with limited documentation, where rearchitecting or refactoring is necessary before considering a cloud migration. Before engaging in such an endeavour, organizations need to make sure that the technical knowledge base of those applications is available.

### How CAST can help

In a week, organizations can scan source code of hundreds of custom applications on [CAST Highlight](https://learn.castsoftware.com/highlight) to automatically categorize them using a model such as the Gartner 5Rs (Rehost, Refactor, Rearchitect, Rebuild and Retire), get a list of cloud Blockers and remediation effort estimates, recommended AWS services, open source risks (CVEs, obsolescence and copyleft license risks), as well as a Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) to best mitigate these risks.

[CAST Highlight](https://learn.castsoftware.com/highlight) is non-intrusive as the source code doesn't leave the organization premises and it doesn't touch applications in production. It cover 50+ programming languages, 12+ database types and hundreds of frameworks: mainframe, Java, .NET, C# and many more. See [here](https://doc.casthighlight.com/#technologycoverage) for a full list.

[CAST Imaging](https://learn.castsoftware.com/imaging) is a complementary solution (covered in another Workshop) to automatically reverse-engineer the architecture of complex applications to Rearchitect or Refactor through interactive maps.

Beyond the initial analysis, CAST Highlight is used for continuous progress monitoring of the journey-to-cloud program, providing trending views and to serve as an application knowledge base throughout the lifecycle of the applications.
