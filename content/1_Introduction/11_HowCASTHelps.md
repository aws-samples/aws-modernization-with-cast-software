### CAST Highlight helps you to:

- Build an objective migration roadmap across an entire application portfolio using the 5R segmentation model (Rehost, Refactor, Rearchitect, Rebuild and Retire -- in a similar fashion to the [AWS migration 7Rs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/prescriptive-guidance/latest/application-portfolio-assessment-guide/prioritization-and-migration-strategy.html#migration-r-type))
- Pinpoint cloud migration Blockers with estimated effort to remediate them as well as cloud migration Boosters that can be leveraged
- Identify suitable AWS services that are good candidates to utilize given your application technology stack
- Detect Open Source security vulnerabilities (CVEs), licensing risk ([CopyLeft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_license)) and obsolescence components
- Mitigate that risk by getting automated recommendations for safer versions to adopt and generate the Software Bill of Materials
- View trends over time throughout the lifecycle of your applications
