## Wrapping up the workshop
Now that we're done, we can mop up the resources that were required for completing this workshop.

Your demo account will be automatically cleaned up within a few days. As for local files:

#### If you have worked on a physical machine or an existing VM

You may now  
* delete the two code repositories you downloaded for this workshop
* delete the scan results files (.csv and .zip files)
* uninstall the CAST Highlight Agent from the computer.

#### If you spun up an EC2 instance specifically for this workshop

You may now discard it. Step 3 of [this tutorial](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/WindowsGuide/EC2_GetStarted.html) explains how to do this. 

If you are managing other virtual machines, make sure that the EC2 instance you're terminating is the one you created for this workshop.
