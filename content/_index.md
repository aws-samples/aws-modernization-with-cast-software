# Application Portfolio Modernization with CAST Highlight 
![CAST Logo](/images/CAST_Logo.png) 

## Accelerate the Modernization of a Portfolio of Applications to AWS, and on AWS 

In this workshop, you will learn how to use CAST Highlight to automatically and accurately analyze the cloud readiness of a portfolio of hundreds of custom applications of any technology in a week. This applies to both applications that still run on-premise or have been lifted-and-shifted to AWS, Google or Azure already, helping you to determine how to migrate & modernize them on AWS in a rapid and safe way. 

Beyond the initial assessment, you will also learn how to leverage CAST Highlight to track progress of your journey-to-cloud program throughout its lifetime, and continuously analyze the open source safety and software health of your entire portfolio over time, as applications keep getting modernized and evolve further. 

## Workshop Objectives

In this workshop, you will learn how to: 
- Onboard custom applications into CAST Highlight by scanning the static, on-premise application source code without touching the applications in production
- Navigate and extract relevant insights automatically generated by CAST Highlight on Cloud Readiness, Open Source Safety and Software Health, at both the portfolio and application levels
- Identify cloud migration Blockers in each application and estimate effort to remove them 
- Identify recommended AWS services 
- Support your journey-to-cloud program

### Target audience

Executing this workshop to completion does not require any specific skills. The insights provided by CAST Highlight cover the spectrum from developers (code insightsa and cloud blockers) through CIOs (portfolio advisors) therefore some of the feedback will be more relevant to those with some programming experience.  

## Workshop Agenda and resrouces

1. Introduction 
2. Onboard 2 sample applications into a CAST Highlight sandbox 
3. Interpret insights automatically generated by CAST Highlight on the 2 applications 
4. Interpret insights automatically generated by CAST Highlight on a pre-loaded sample portfolio of 200+ applications 
5. Learn how to manage your migration & modernization program continuously using CAST Highlight 

Plan on taking about 1.5 hours to complete the full workshop.

### Resources requirements and cost

The use of the CAST Highlight Agent and demonstration portfolio for the purposes of this workshop is completely free.

The local code analysis can be run on any windows machine with a modern browser. If you opt to spin up an EC2 instance specifically for this purpose, you might incur the associated costs (although the computation requirements are well within the free tier).

All resources will be [cleaned up at the end of the workshop](/5_conclusion/51_cleanup.html).
