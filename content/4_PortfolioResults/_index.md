# The Big Picture

Now that we have seen how the code scan results can be leveraged to gather detailed actionable insight to make our applications healthier or more cloud-ready, it's time to get some altitude and look at the broader picture.

### What's my use case?
Here are a few typical challenges that are faced by many people with key roles in IT:
- *We have launched a move-to-cloud initiative but we're not really sure where to start.*
- *We have already migrated many of our applications to the cloud but for many of them this was a pure lift-and-shift and we'd like to further leverage cloud computing capabilities.*
- *We have several applications running on multiple cloud platforms and we want to consolidate them on AWS.*

As much as these situations denote very different levels of cloud adoption and maturity, they all have two things in common:
1. They require visibility to evaluate their options and make viable decisions. 
2. CAST Highlight can help them! 

### Seeing it live
Let's go back to the home page of the CAST Highlight portfolio. This can always be done by clicking on the ***Home*** button in the top menu:

From here, we want to switch our attention to the *Read-Only Environment* by clicking on the funnel icon in the top right:

We're now looking at the overall results of a ~200 applications portfolio. The following sections demonstrate how you can use all the portfolio-level information gathered in CAST Highlight to guide your strategic IT decisions.

 The applications shown in this *sandbox* portfolio are publicly shared to give an overview of all of CAST Highlight's capabilities. This portfolio is shared between all the users of this workshop. It's worth mentioning that when you do have your own CAST Highlight subscription, your portfolio will be on your own instance and none of it will be shared with other clients.
